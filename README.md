# AnySound2BT
Force android to play audio and MP3 in non-A2DP BT headset.

#Background:
In Android non A2DP headsets(like single ear BT devices) is not allowed to play non-call audio.
This is a simple trick to play the audio in BT even when not in call.

#How to use:

->You should be connected to the Bluetooth Device(Updated code to only toggle button if BT is connected|paired).

->Now Go to this application and toggle the button "ON".

->Now play the music or any audio from any of your favorite application.

->Sound should be routed to the BT device.

->Please report an github issue if any device is not able to route audio to BT.(Recently found a crash on connecting to Logitech X300 , if anybody finds it please please attach logs!--> Fixed )
